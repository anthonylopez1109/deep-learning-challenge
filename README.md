# Alphabet Soup Deep Learning Challenge
Overview
The objective of this project was to build a binary classification model that predicts whether an organization, funded by Alphabet Soup, will be successful in its mission. Using a dataset containing over 34,000 previous applicants, we developed a deep learning model with TensorFlow to help the nonprofit organization select the most promising applicants based on their chances of success.

Steps Completed
1. Preprocessing the Data
The first step was to clean and preprocess the dataset before feeding it into a neural network model. Here's what was done:

Dropped unnecessary columns: The columns EIN and NAME were dropped because they contained non-beneficial information.
Categorical Data Encoding: Applied one-hot encoding (pd.get_dummies()) to convert categorical variables (e.g., APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, etc.) into numerical format.
Replaced rare categories: For columns like APPLICATION_TYPE and CLASSIFICATION, categories with low frequencies were combined into a new category labeled "Other" to avoid sparseness.
Split the data: The data was split into two arrays: features (X) and the target variable (IS_SUCCESSFUL).
Train-Test Split: The dataset was split into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn to ensure the model could be trained and evaluated properly.
Feature Scaling: We scaled the feature data using StandardScaler to normalize the input features for the neural network model.
2. Building and Training the Model
Once the data was preprocessed, we built a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras. The architecture consisted of the following layers:

Input Layer: The number of input features (the number of columns after preprocessing).
Hidden Layers: Three hidden layers with 80, 30, and 10 neurons, respectively. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function was used for these layers to introduce non-linearity.
Output Layer: A single output node with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification (success or failure).
After designing the model, we compiled it with:

Loss function: Binary cross-entropy (appropriate for binary classification tasks).
Optimizer: Adam optimizer for efficient weight updates.
Metrics: Accuracy to track model performance during training.
3. Model Training and Evaluation
We trained the model using the scaled training data (X_train_scaled and y_train) for 75 epochs, which provided sufficient iterations to adjust the weights for better accuracy.

We then evaluated the model's performance using the test data (X_test_scaled and y_test). The accuracy obtained during the evaluation was 74.67%.

4. Optimization and Model Enhancement
To improve the modelâ€™s performance, we attempted several optimizations:

Hyperparameter Tuning: We tried adjusting the number of neurons, layers, and epochs to see if we could achieve higher accuracy.
Validation Set: A validation set was used during training to prevent overfitting and to monitor model performance with EarlyStopping callback (which stops training if the validation loss does not improve after several epochs).
Training with more epochs: We experimented with increasing the epochs and utilized validation data to assess model generalization.
Despite our optimizations, we could not exceed 75% accuracy.

5. Final Results and Model Export
The final trained model was saved into an HDF5 file (AlphabetSoupCharity.h5). This model can now be used for predictions on new applicant data.

6. Repository Files
The following files were created during the project:

alphabet_soup_charity_model.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.
alphabet_soup_charity_optimization.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for attempting optimizations to improve model accuracy.
AlphabetSoupCharity.h5: The final trained model file.
AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5: The optimized model file after training with additional hyperparameters (if applicable).
7. Future Work
While the model achieved 74.67% accuracy, further optimization efforts could include:

Hyperparameter search for a better combination of neurons, layers, activation functions, etc.
Cross-validation to reduce variance in the results.
Exploring more advanced architectures (e.g., adding dropout layers to reduce overfitting).
Feature engineering: More sophisticated preprocessing techniques or additional features could potentially improve model performance.
